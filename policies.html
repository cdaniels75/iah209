      <h1>Course Policies</h1>
      <h3>Late Assignments:</h3>
      <p>Late assignments will be lowered one full letter grade for each day past the due date (the first reduction occurs at the start of the class in which the assignment is due).</p>
      <h3>Academic Honesty:</h3>
      <p>Michigan State University has adopted the following statement about academic policy:
<br />GENERAL STUDENT REGULATIONS
<br />1.00 PROTECTION OF SCHOLARSHIP AND GRADES
<ul>The principles of truth and honesty are fundamental to the educational process and the academic integrity of the University; therefore, no student shall:
<li>1.01 claim or submit the academic work of another as one’s own.</li>
<li>1.02 procure, provide, accept or use any materials containing questions or answers to any examination or assignment without proper authorization.</li>
<li>1.03 complete or attempt to complete any assignment or examination for another individual without proper authorization.</li>
<li>1.04 allow any examination or assignment to be completed for oneself, in part or in total, by another without proper authorization.</li>
<li>1.05 alter, tamper with, appropriate, destroy or otherwise interfere with the research, resources, or other academic work of another person.
<li>1.06 fabricate or falsify data or results.</li></ul>
<p>Procedures for responding to cases of academic honesty and possible repercussions are outlined in Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide.  They can also be found on the web at: http://www.msu.edu/unit/ombud/honestylinks.html.  Note: the new procedures require that instances of academic dishonesty be reported through the registrar’s office and forwarded to the Dean of the College in which the student’s major resides.</p>

<h3>University Resources for Writers:</h3>

<p>The Writing Center, the Library, The Learning Resource Center, and the English Language Center all offer support services for writing students.  You should consult these centers’ web sites for information about their specific resources.</p>

<h3>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:</h3>

<p>Michigan State University is committed to providing equal opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities may be made by contacting the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities at 517-884- RCPD or on the web at rcpd.msu.edu. Once your eligibility for an accommodation has been determined, you will be issued a verified individual services accommodation ("RISA") form. Please present this form to me at the start of the term and/or two weeks prior to the accommodation date (test, project, etc.). Requests received after this date will be honored whenever possible.</p>

<h3>Major Assignments:</h3>

<p><span class="logo_colour">Film Response Papers (4) - 20%</span></p>

<p>For each film, you will write a paper of 1200-1500 words integrating your analysis of the course readings with your analysis of the film.  These papers should be doubled-spaced with 1-inch margins and be formatted correctly according to MLA or APA specifications.  Furthermore each paper should have a clear purpose and contain coherent and developed arguments that support that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="logo_colour">Midterm Examination - 10%</span></p>

<p>The Midterm Examination will cover the first half of the course readings.  It will be consist of several multiple choice and short answer questions as well as a choice of one essay question.</p>

<p><span class="logo_colour">Brainstorming Worksheets - 10%</span></p>                  

<p>Frequently in the course you will be expected to complete and submit assigned worksheets which require you to brainstorm for your film response papers .  These are meant to direct you to important concepts in the films and allow you to begin relating what you have read to the films we see in class.  Additionally, they are an opportunity to get feedback before you finish writing your response papers.</p>

<p><span class="logo_colour">Group Presentation - 10%</span></p>

<p>In small groups, you will be required to present one major reading to the rest of the class. NB: This is not merely compiling quotations from the text but also providing analysis and interpretation of the work.</p>

<p><span class="logo_colour">Individual Presentation - 10%</span></p>

<p>Similar to the group presentation, individually you will be responsible for delivering a presentation on one of the shorter readings in the course.  Like the group presentations, you will need to provide analysis and interpretation of the text in addition to any quotations.</p>

<p><span class="logo_colour">Multimodal Final Project - 20%</span></p>

<p>For the final project in the course, you will select a film of your own choosing and create a website (or other multimedia resource) using outside research as well as course readings.  You will be evaluated both on the richness of the content and the execution of the multimedia elements of the project.</p>

<p><span class="logo_colour">Final Examination - 20%</span></p>

<p>The Final Examination will be a cumulative exam that will cover all materials in the course.  It will consist of a variety of multiple choice and short answer questions as well as a choice of one essay question.</p>


<h3>Grading Scale:</h3>

<p>92% - 100% = 4.0
<br />87.5% - 91.9% = 3.5
<br />80% - 87.4%   = 3.0
<br />75% - 79.9%   = 2.5
<br />70% - 74.9%   = 2.0
<br />65% - 69.9%   = 1.5
<br />60% - 64.9%   = 1.0
<br />59.9% and below = 0.0</p>
